 Class & Objects,static variables (class variables)
 
 CLASS:
 
 ->Classes and Objects are basic concepts of Object Oriented Programming which revolve around the real life entities.
 
 ->A class is a user defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created.
 ->It represents the set of properties or methods that are common to all objects of one type.
 
 
    Modifiers: A class can be public or has default access .
    
    class keyword: class keyword is used to create a class.
    
    Class name: The name should begin with an initial letter (capitalized by convention).
    
    Superclass(if any): The name of the classâ€™s parent (superclass), if any, preceded by the keyword extends. A class can only extend (subclass) one parent.
    
    Interfaces(if any): A comma-separated list of interfaces implemented by the class, if any, preceded by the keyword implements. 
                        A class can implement more than one interface.
                        
    Body: The class body surrounded by braces, { }.
    
    Access specifiers for classes or interfaces in Java:
   In Java, methods and data members can be encapsulated by the following four access specifiers. 
   The access specifiers are listed according to their restrictiveness order. 
   
1) private (accessible within the class where defined) 
2) default or package-private (when no access specifier is specified) 
3) protected (accessible only to classes that subclass your class directly within the current or different package)
4) public (accessible from any class)

But, the classes and interfaces themselves can have only two access specifiers when declared outside any other class. 
1) public 
2) default (when no access specifier is specified)

Note: Nested interfaces and classes can have all access specifiers.
Note: We cannot declare class/interface with private or protected access specifiers.
